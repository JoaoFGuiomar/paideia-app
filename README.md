## Starting the Project

- Clone the repo from [Paideia Github](https://github.com/paideiadao/paideia-app)
- Rename the `.env.local.sample` file to `.env`
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- Success!

## Contributing

- Work should be done off beta branch
- One PR per issue please. Large PRs with many changes are hard to review and can cause merge conflicts with others' work.
- Assign yourself to an issue when you pick it up so we know who is working on what and people don't work on the same thing
- Add "- Fixes: (ISSUE LINK)" to your PR description so it links the PR with the issue
- The required .env file is .env.local.template, make sure you rename it to .env
